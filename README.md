# Tired of messy URLs?
Every time you share a link, it’s loaded with tracking data—ads, analytics, and who knows what else. Want to clean that up?

# Introducing: Better Share™!
With Better Share™, you can strip away all that tracking junk from URLs and make them easier to share and embed. No more cluttered links or tracking your every move—just clean, simple URLs that work anywhere.

### Site suggestions
If you would like support for a site make a [issue](https://github.com/LeCloutPanda/BetterShare/issues) requesting what site you would like and what you would like to filter/replace from said site.

### TODO
- [ ] **Make a better popup menu**: Finish the popup menu to add setting supports and make it look prettier
- [ ] **Finish config page**: Finish and implement configuration options to allow custom replacement urls
- [ ] **Option to add custom urls**: If possible allow the user to add their own url and redirect to the extension rather then needing to wait for official support
- [ ] **On the fly setting generation**: Given a set of arrays it will generate the extension settings, popup ui elements when opening the extension and more
